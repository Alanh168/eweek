               Build-It it is an annual community outreach event organized and hosted by the University of Miami’s American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Build-It  is primarily a science and engineering based competition where schools get to take part in a timed design  and construction effort which they will then put to the test against the other attendees. The winning team is then awarded the Build-It trophy until the next year. Aside from the fun competition Build-It also invites professional speakers to inspire and expose students to the multiple possible and extraordinary routes to success and opportunity in higher education especially in the STEM based fields. Overall build-it is a massive event meant to expose students to the fundamentals of stem and spark the flame to future great scientific minds, and to remind kids that no matter what they've been told they have opportunity in the world.
