                  <p> The University of Miami IEEE would like to bring you UHack, a 24-hour hackathon. UHack will take place at the beginning of Engineers Week, Saturday February 20th, and finish the next day, Sunday February 21st. Taking place in the Ballrooms in the Student Activity Center at the University of Miami, we are open to any student from any educational institution who would like to take some time off their semester by making something fun and possibly win some great prizes from our amazing sponsors. All for FREE. </p> <br>

<p> This year, we are going to FIND THE DEVELOPER IN U and focus on building projects for the benefit of improving oneâ€™s lifestyle. This completely open-ended, you can utilize any platform, framework, language, or hardware device they desire and utilize it to their own will for the benefit of making something better. You can start from scratch or hack something previously created in order to change/improve its functionality or purpose. If you want to make a real-life life-hack, this is the place to be! </p>

Tools and engines will be provide, and a workshop leader will guide you every step of the way  The event will take place on February 26 here at the University of Miami for more details rsvp your spot today by emailing .  <a href="mailto:hurricaneasme@gmail.com" target="_blank"><span autoid="_rpc_6">hurricaneasme@gmail.com</span></a>

               Build-It it is an annual community outreach event organized and hosted by the University of Miamiâ€™s American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Build-It  is primarily a science and engineering based competition where schools get to take part in a timed design  and construction effort which they will then put to the test against the other attendees. The winning team is then awarded the Build-It trophy until the next year. Aside from the fun competition Build-It also invites professional speakers to inspire and expose students to the multiple possible and extraordinary routes to success and opportunity in higher education especially in the STEM based fields. Overall build-it is a massive event meant to expose students to the fundamentals of stem and spark the flame to future great scientific minds, and to remind kids that no matter what they've been told they have opportunity in the world.
